- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Media Query

### What I learned

The most challenge was the css. This project it's far more hard than any other that i made.
And of course the implementation of JS was a good challenge.

### Continued development

I want to make adjusts to the CSS, somethings are not like i want it to be. So i will chance in the future.
Also i want to make the input of Mortgage Amount to show the numbers with commas
